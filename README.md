# Summer of Bitcoin - Task 1

#### Time Complexity of Proposed Solution
For number of transactions to be *n*
- Creating set for transactions = O(nlogn)
- For getting valid transaction and appending it in block = O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Overall time complexity of solution = O(n<sup>2</sup>)

#### Program Information
- **Language:** C++
- **Code file:** main.cpp
- **Output file:** block.txt
- **Dataset:** mempool.csv

#### Results
1. Transaction Count :5214
2. Total Fees in Current Block : 5696031
3. Total Weight : 3999936
4. Transactions in Final Block : 3174
